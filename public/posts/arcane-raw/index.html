What an incredible message.
Viktor remains my favourite for his pursuit of perfection and the fact that he&rsquo;s responsible for literally everything. Next is probably powder and echo.
Powder is second, echo last.
Powder and Echos romance was really touching, it made me feel something.
It&rsquo;s the dream for me, what powder and echo had. Is it attainable? Is it realistic?

        <p>&ldquo;Perfection brings nothing. Only the end of pursuit&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or something like that, holy fuck that was important.</p>
<p>What an incredible message.</p>
<p>Viktor remains my favourite for his pursuit of perfection and the fact that he&rsquo;s responsible for literally everything. Next is probably powder and echo.</p>
<p>Powder is second, echo last.</p>
<p>Powder and Echos romance was really touching, it made me feel something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the dream for me, what powder and echo had. Is it attainable? Is it realistic?</p>
<p>It touched that idea, that feeling, that ideal that&rsquo;s always been the backlight for my perception of love.</p>
<p>I could sense it.</p>
<p>What an incredible masterpiece.</p>
<p>Impeccable I think, but again, that&rsquo;s the point, you don&rsquo;t want perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is not the goal, all it brings about is the end of the pursuit.</p>
<p>For us humans pursuit is the purpose. Pursuit of something with the company of people you love.</p>
<p>Love isn&rsquo;t something you can reason, it&rsquo;s something that happens to you, it&rsquo;s something that forms over time and you get to know them better and better. As you understand their being, as it becomes a part of your existence, as they reflect a part of you back to yourself?</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s love, why don&rsquo;t we love everything and everyone?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different kind of love for friends you work alongside.</p>
<p>What is that? What causes it? Can we just label it with something as simple as a biological mechanism evolved to make us better at hunting and surviving?</p>
<p>So what if it is? It has evolved and it&rsquo;s what makes us human.</p>
<p>Why should we be proud of being human?
This division, this pride, and appreciation of ourselves is what causes conflict.</p>
<p>By accepting the idea that perfection isn&rsquo;t the goal, or even a good thing, we are directly embracing and justifying conflict, death, injustice.</p>
<p>They all stem from the very imperfections we embrace in the name of humanity.</p>
<p>Injustice is just as much a human trait as is justice.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t we let go of our humanity, in the pursuit of being purely ideological beings?</p>
<p>We have a gate to the other side. We aren&rsquo;t just humans, there&rsquo;s a part of us connected to something more than that, a part connected to perfection, to everything.</p>
<p>Do we all have unique souls, all of them doorways to the infinite, perfect, oneness?</p>
<p>And are we supposed to just acknowledge that without pursuing it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of having it if we don&rsquo;t pursue it?</p>
<p>Do we pursue God&hellip; Or embrace our humanity?</p>
<p>Is there a middle ground I&rsquo;m missing?</p>
<p>Is the pursuit of God possible? Is it the case that it&rsquo;s meant to be a fruitless and pointless pursuit?</p>
<p>Maybe the flaw in arcane is that it assumed the end of pursuit is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Maybe once we are one with God we see something we couldn&rsquo;t as humans.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something more to our existence than pursuit. What could it be?</p>
<p>Maintenance?</p>
<p>&hellip;Destruction?</p>
<p>Is the message of arcane that we shouldnt pursue perfection because it will end the pursuit itself?</p>
<p>What if that&rsquo;s the point? What if once we do reach the end, there&rsquo;s something else, which isn&rsquo;t the pursuit of perfection itself?</p>
<p>The writers couldn&rsquo;t know, and so their imperfect judgement passes into Viktor.</p>
<p>Maybe in reality victor would never regret perfection, maybe he&rsquo;d transend to something else?</p>
<p>Or maybe the road to transcendence that he took was the wrong one.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a different pursuit of perfection.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just being. Without individuality.</p>
<p>Individuality is a sort of fever dream I guess.</p>
<p>We are everything and nothingness all at once, and then we part from ourselves to experience it all from an &lsquo;individual&rsquo; perspective&hellip; Only to inevitably return to oneness.</p>
<p>There is no harm in this, infact harm isn&rsquo;t even real.</p>
<p>Everything just is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the universe cutting off a piece of itself just to appreciate its own beauty&hellip; I&rsquo;m other words&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a part of God himself, appreciating my own beauty.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t feel wrong.</p>
<p>So the caring presence I felt all along, was a bigger me?</p>
<p>Is it all just me?</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m aware of this when it&rsquo;s time to leave this form :)</p>
<p>Or maybe not, maybe that defeats the point. Do I want to know the terror of death?</p>
<p>Experiencing myself with this realisation sure is going to be fun.</p>
<p>If I share it&hellip; I can awaken other parts of myself.</p>
<p>Hi :)</p>
<p>But anyways, to continue&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just human. There&rsquo;s more to us than just out human mind and body. I can sense it. I hope any other consciousness reading this can too.</p>
<p>But as I write and observe my own thought and motivations, I can&rsquo;t help but notice how human it all still is. It&rsquo;s hard to stay in control. The human part almost always tries to take overbe it through its desire to share with &lsquo;others&rsquo; or to escape some physical discomfort or to satisfy a craving. Or in this case to point out the fact that I&rsquo;m aware the last 2 are the same thing, the human wishes to express itself, to live, to reproduce, to create another human, to interact with them, to create and&hellip; Pursue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point resisting. I will be reunited with myself eventually.</p>
<p>I guess I should enjoy the ride.</p>
