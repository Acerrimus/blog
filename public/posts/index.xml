      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been observing my patterns again, and over the course of last week I noticed something: Life is so much better when you allocate a specific purpose to each day beforehand.
Context I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through the Bhagvad Geeta [LINK TO GEETA DISCUSSION] over and over again for the last few months, and one of the most beneficial concepts that it has taught me is the concept of Dharma (Duty). It gave me a more profound understnading of myself and the nature of the universe we live in too, and Oneness, and all that good stuff, bu I&amp;rsquo;ll leave all that for a later post [LINK TO LATER POST].</description>
