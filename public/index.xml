      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to split my site into sections, cause I intent to share insights on both internal and external philosophy (external philosophy could be argued ot be politics or societal commentary) as well as anything that has helped me with general productivity/wellbeing, and random blog stuff.
The goal is for this Blog to be USEFUL to anyone who comes accross it, and I will try my best to make it so.</description>
