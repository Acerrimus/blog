      <description>WHat am I trying to get at here? Every day of your life should be lived with a clear purpose in mind.
If you do this, you can&amp;rsquo;t have bad days as long as you genuinely try your best Your purpose for a day can simply be to rest and recover You will feel so much happier and more content if you genuinely tried your best every day. You&amp;rsquo;re basically guaranteed to succeed as long as you stick to it.</description>
