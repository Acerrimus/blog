## Wtf is going on Sahil?

I'm trying to sub categorise my blogs into guides - personal posts - and other forms, but strugglignto figure it all out,that's why my site is all over the place. I don't care about making mistakes rn, or doing things ineffectively, I'm just playing around to wrap my head around things.

That being said, please excuse any grammatical, logical, structural, philosophical, or whatever the fuck else kinda mistakes, I'm still learning and trying to show the process :)


Message from Future Sahil: Rest assured, I have lots of good posts ready, they're just all in the draft stage. I'll release a couple really mid ones first though.
