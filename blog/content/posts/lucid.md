Maybe there's a different pursuit of perfection.

Maybe it's just being. Without individuality.

Individuality is a sort of fever dream I guess.

We are everything and nothingness all at once, and then we part from ourselves to experience it all from an 'individual' perspective... Only to inevitably return to oneness.

There is no harm in this, infact harm isn't even real.

Everything just is.

I'm the universe cutting off a piece of itself just to appreciate its own beauty... In other words...

I'm a part of God himself, appreciating my own beauty.

This doesn't feel wrong.

So the caring presence I felt all along, was a bigger me? 

Is it all just me?

I hope I'm aware of this when it's time to leave this form :)

Or maybe not, maybe that defeats the point. Do I want to know the terror of death?

Experiencing myself with this realisation sure is going to be fun.

If I share it... I can awaken other parts of myself.

Hi :)



But anyways, to continue...

We're not just human. There's more to us than just out human mind and body. I can sense it. I hope any other consciousness reading this can too.

But as I write and observe my own thought and motivations, I can't help but notice how human it all still is. It's hard to stay in control. The human part almost always tries to take over, be it through its desire to share with 'others' or to escape some physical discomfort or to satisfy a craving. Or in this case to point out the fact that I'm aware the last 2 are the same thing, the human wishes to express itself, to live, to reproduce, to create another human, to interact with them, to create and... Pursue.

There's no point resisting. I will be reunited with myself eventually.

I guess I should enjoy the ride.
