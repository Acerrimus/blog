"Perfection brings nothing. Only the end of pursuit"

Or something like that, holy fuck that was important.

What an incredible message.

Viktor remains my favourite for his pursuit of perfection and the fact that he's responsible for literally everything. Next is probably powder and echo.

Powder is second, echo last.

Powder and Echos romance was really touching, it made me feel something.

It's the dream for me, what powder and echo had. Is it attainable? Is it realistic?

It touched that idea, that feeling, that ideal that's always been the backlight for my perception of love.

I could sense it.

What an incredible masterpiece.

Impeccable I think, but again, that's the point, you don't want perfection.

Perfection is not the goal, all it brings about is the end of the pursuit.

For us humans pursuit is the purpose. Pursuit of something with the company of people you love. 

Love isn't something you can reason, it's something that happens to you, it's something that forms over time and you get to know them better and better. As you understand their being, as it becomes a part of your existence, as they reflect a part of you back to yourself?

But if that's love, why don't we love everything and everyone?

There's a different kind of love for friends you work alongside.

What is that? What causes it? Can we just label it with something as simple as a biological mechanism evolved to make us better at hunting and surviving?

So what if it is? It has evolved and it's what makes us human.

Why should we be proud of being human?
This division, this pride, and appreciation of ourselves is what causes conflict. 

By accepting the idea that perfection isn't the goal, or even a good thing, we are directly embracing and justifying conflict, death, injustice.

They all stem from the very imperfections we embrace in the name of humanity.

Injustice is just as much a human trait as is justice.

Why shouldn't we let go of our humanity, in the pursuit of being purely ideological beings? 

We have a gate to the other side. We aren't just humans, there's a part of us connected to something more than that, a part connected to perfection, to everything.

Do we all have unique souls, all of them doorways to the infinite, perfect, oneness?

And are we supposed to just acknowledge that without pursuing it?

What's the point of having it if we don't pursue it?

Do we pursue God... Or embrace our humanity?

Is there a middle ground I'm missing?

Is the pursuit of God possible? Is it the case that it's meant to be a fruitless and pointless pursuit?

Maybe the flaw in arcane is that it assumed the end of pursuit is a bad thing.

Maybe once we are one with God we see something we couldn't as humans.

Maybe there's something more to our existence than pursuit. What could it be?

Maintenance?

...Destruction?

Is the message of arcane that we shouldnt pursue perfection because it will end the pursuit itself?

What if that's the point? What if once we do reach the end, there's something else, which isn't the pursuit of perfection itself?

The writers couldn't know, and so their imperfect judgement passes into Viktor.

Maybe in reality victor would never regret perfection, maybe he'd transend to something else?

Or maybe the road to transcendence that he took was the wrong one.

Maybe there's a different pursuit of perfection.

Maybe it's just being. Without individuality.

Individuality is a sort of fever dream I guess.

We are everything and nothingness all at once, and then we part from ourselves to experience it all from an 'individual' perspective... Only to inevitably return to oneness.

There is no harm in this, infact harm isn't even real.

Everything just is.

I'm the universe cutting off a piece of itself just to appreciate its own beauty... I'm other words...

I'm a part of God himself, appreciating my own beauty.

This doesn't feel wrong.

So the caring presence I felt all along, was a bigger me? 

Is it all just me?

I hope I'm aware of this when it's time to leave this form :)

Or maybe not, maybe that defeats the point. Do I want to know the terror of death?

Experiencing myself with this realisation sure is going to be fun.

If I share it... I can awaken other parts of myself.

Hi :)



But anyways, to continue...

We're not just human. There's more to us than just out human mind and body. I can sense it. I hope any other consciousness reading this can too.

But as I write and observe my own thought and motivations, I can't help but notice how human it all still is. It's hard to stay in control. The human part almost always tries to take overbe it through its desire to share with 'others' or to escape some physical discomfort or to satisfy a craving. Or in this case to point out the fact that I'm aware the last 2 are the same thing, the human wishes to express itself, to live, to reproduce, to create another human, to interact with them, to create and... Pursue.

There's no point resisting. I will be reunited with myself eventually.

I guess I should enjoy the ride.
