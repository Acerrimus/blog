<p>Rating: 8/10</p>
<p>I find myself coming back to this book over and over again (Like most of the other books in this list), even after having periods of dismissing spirituality and the idea of &lsquo;Masculinity&rsquo; as red pilled pseudoscience. I cannot speak for the objective validity of the claims made in this book, but what I can say is that they are a very good reflection of something very real and very important.</p>
<p>The most important idea I got from this book is the idea of your individual Edge, and the importance of understanding, honouring, and living by it. The idea is that almost everyone falls short of their true capacity for living life to the fullest because they let their fears hold them back; fear of failure, fear of success, fear of ridicule, and so on. Deida calls the reader out and through his writing helps bring an idea of the reader&rsquo;s truer edge to the surface. He invites you to take a moment to appreciate what you would be capable of if you didn&rsquo;t let these fears stop you if you were truly fearless. When I first read this book at the age of 15 and lived by it for around a month, I recall it being some of the most transformational times of my life. I called it living by my &lsquo;Core&rsquo;, which if I had to put it into words I would describe as what Nietzsche&rsquo;s &lsquo;baby&rsquo; creates for himself after the three metamorphoses. I felt completely free of the burdens of the camel, felt like I had faced the dragon (or the version of it that I knew at the time), and was able to freely decide the things I cared about deep within as the only values to live by, and then acted based on that. At that time the biggest part of my core was my dream, but it was somewhat different from what it is now.</p>
<p>Overall the book dives very deep into spirituality, and seems to stem from a deep realisation of Infinity / Oneness. It does a commendable job at combining ideas of Masculinity with more traditional spirituality.</p>
