Ash has been a huge help while I'm still in training wheels on everything CS, and is the inspiration for this blog, should definitely go check him out.

**[Charlie Morgan](https://www.youtube.com/@charliemofficial)**

Honestly, this guy popped into my feed out no nowhere and started posting the most well thought out and useful bangers I've ever seen. He's a huge inspiration and somebody I look up to because he seeems to think a lot like me, and has that sort of ambition to conquer the world that I look for in people. I hope to make this blog as useful as his channel if not more.

**[Hamza](https://www.youtube.com/@Hamza97)**

His new content is very hit or miss as he's still learning what it means to be a good leader and person just like all of us, but his old content is incredibly valueable, if there is any relatively big part of your life you are struggling with or would like ot simply improve, he probably has a comprehensive guide on it (stuff like diet, mental health, buliding an aesthetic physique, dopamine detox, growth mindset etc.) Avoid the new clickbaity stuff.

Ofc if you're here you probably already know Hamza, but this is for those who may be new to the idea of self improvement

**[Alex Hormozi](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexHormozi)**

Best overall business youtube channel. NOthign more to add to it. Nobody will give you more free value than Hormozi.

Again, everyone already knows him, but this is for anyone getting started.

My philosophy doesn't allow me to trust therapists cause most of them wouldn't be normal therapists if they were as ambitious as I need them to be to accept any of their ideas, but this guy is genuinely very cool, he knows exactly what he's talking about, his approach is trained on a diverse angle and involved auvedic approaches too + He's got a great business and IMO good charisma.

**[ALEX LABS](https://www.youtube.com/@ALEXLAB)**

Mf is one of the coolest engineers I've ever seen. Can't wait for his collab with Hacksmith
