I was reading Deep Work by Cal Newport while simultaneously processing one of the most important issues I’ve been having in my life, I seem to know exactly what to do and when to do it, I know so many techniques and philosophies, and I’m excellent and giving advice to others on precisely what they need to do right now, and do so with certainty that if they followed it exactly, they’d succeed.

I was thinking about how a week or so ago I told a friend of mine I met at the gym, we’ll call him Billy, that the next best book for him to read would the Deep Work, as he was already reading The Chimp Paradox, and that sent me down the thought stream of recognising some books are literal guides to excellence if followed without question, and I have read these books, that’s why I know that. 

(If you are curious about what books I believe fit that category, check out my Book Recommendations page. [LINK HERE])

But then if I’ve read all these books that give me the knowledge of the greats that came before me, and even live alongside me and obtain lives and character I aspire towards, why am I not like them?

One simple paradigm: I am reading these books as suggestions, not guides.

This approach has its merits, it allows me to be like water, to absorb all these ideas and sharpen them against each other and play around with them like clay, to make something of my own (Which is what this blog is in a way), but it also has its drawbacks. 

I am essentially saying “Yes Mr Newport, these are great ideas, very interesting indeed, please leave them with me and I’m sure I will find a use for them at some point”, before swiftly ushering Mr Steve Peters in to hear his works on the mind, as he was getting impatient listening to Osho and Krishna discuss ideas on what exactly Dharma is.

This obviously can’t be right, I am in no position to take these people’s teachings as mere products, suggestions, instead I should be approaching the entire business of reading a book like that of adopting a new coach. You listen **very** carefully to what they have to say, and then **implement** their suggestions to the best of their ability, and then when you have questions, you look further in their books, and try to see if they can relay an answer to you through their works, I believe most well written books will answer any reasonable question you have as long as you are willing to read it carefully and thoroughly, and have a decent enough head on your shoulders to do basic reasoning.

And that is why I suggest treating books like Coaches, not Clients.

I will be implementing this approach to my readings, and documenting my findings and experiences here, if you are reading this in the somewhat distant future, I’m sure you’ll find my personal account useful, cause I imagine if I was the reader, that is **precisely** what I would have requested next. The ins and outs, to pair the pure ideological approach with real life application.
