I've been observing my patterns again, and over the course of last week I noticed something: Life is so much better when you allocate a specific purpose to each day beforehand.

# Context

I've been reading through the Bhagvad Geeta [LINK TO GEETA DISCUSSION] over and over again for the last few months, and one of the most beneficial concepts that it has taught me is the concept of Dharma (Duty). It gave me a more profound understnading of myself and the nature of the universe we live in too, and Oneness, and all that good stuff, bu I'll leave all that for a later post [LINK TO LATER POST].

### What is Dharma?

You can look up any multitude of defenitions of it, but if you asked me to define it, I would define it as your duty as a being, to yourself and the universe (Again, I'll ignore the concept of Oneness for now)



# When your day has no purpose, you fill it up with entertainment and fillers
# When you have a duty, it's really easy to mindfully do nothing but your duty
- - The strength comes from an understanding of Dharma.

# Why Allocate Duty beforehand?
- - As soon as we wakeup theres a flood of thigns demanding our attention and space in our working memory that promise immediate dopamine with little upfront effort
- - You want to delay their grasp on you by already having a clearly defined task [LINK TO EAT THE FROG]


# Anecdote:
- I've been working on Auraboard for the last few weeks, and on wednesday I gave myself a clear goal of getting my Database sorted before I can leave the house, go on social media, or have entertainment or anything.
- If I caught myself slacking off, it was really easy for me to catch it and know exaclty what to do.

- A majority of my issues comes from a lack of objective for each day, week, month, year, decade cause no matter what goal I set, I know its meaningless in the end. That corruption of purpose, of duty is very dangerous, It make smy roots weak. It gives rise to procrastination and hedonism.
